Web-crawling Guangming Daily

This is a project dedicated to crawl the articles of Guangming Daily for textual analysis.

The project began in April, 2018, and has been improved by me from time to time.

Recent added features include:
1. Ask the user to input date range, instead of making the date range embedded in the code.
2. Ask the user to input the gap time for each crawl, adding flexibility to the crawling process.
3. Ask the user to input the path they want, and create the path for the user, avoiding "DirectoryNotFound" errors.
